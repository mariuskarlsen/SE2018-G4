  abstract     = {The notion of using video games for learning causes some to cringe, others to leap for joy, and many to ask questions about this learning medium. These questions often come from people and organizations that are considering delving into the world of learning games but don’t know if this is advisable or don’t know where to start. The goal of this paper is to answer those questions about learning games and to help plot a path for people and organizations interested in developing or fostering the development of video games for learning. The paper starts by making a case for learning games grounded in principles of good fun and good learning. From there the paper explores the commercial games market, gleaning lessons from this rapidly growing and diversifying place. In order to address the concerns of those who see “edutainment” as a dead market, the paper analyzes the downfall of edutainment in the 1990s and establishes how the current movement differs. As there are many applications of games related (more or less) to learning games, the paper lays out the ecology of games with a purpose beyond play. Much of the rest of the paper establishes principles and best practices for moving the field forward in a positive direction. The paper should provide a good grounding in the field and both motivate and inform those wanting to participate in this rapidly growing domain.},

  abstract     = {Gamification, a design technique that uses the motivational elements of games in other contexts, is increasingly looked at as a possible solution to the dropping levels of motivation observed in learners. However, previous research has presented mixed results as to the demonstration of whether gamification in education works or not. To better evaluate the potential of gamification, we argue that it is important to first focus on how gamification works. This chapter contributes to this discussion by asking three research questions, starting by specifying “What is gamification?” (Q1), to then revealing “How does gamification work?” (Q2). Looking at gamification from the perspective of Self-Determination Theory, we show that various types of motivation guide people’s behaviour differently, and point to the importance of basic psychological need satisfaction. Furthermore, the answers to our first two research questions will explain why adding game elements as external, meaningless regulations is likely to cause detrimental effects on learners’ intrinsic motivation. Finally, by cumulating these theory-informed insights, we address our last research question “How can gamification design be improved?” (Q3), and define 9 Gamification Heuristics that account for (the interplay between) design, context and user characteristics. As such, this chapter forms a guide for researchers, educators, designers and software developers in fostering a promising future generation of gamified systems that resonates our plea for theory-driven design.},

Often these studies are the only practicable method of studying various problems, for example, studies of aetiology, instances where a randomised controlled trial might be unethical, or if the condition to be studied is rare. Cohort studies are used to study incidence, causes, and prognosis. Because they measure events in chronological order they can be used to distinguish between cause and effect. Cross sectional studies are used to determine prevalence. They are relatively quick and easy but do not permit distinction between cause and effect. Case controlled studies compare groups retrospectively. They seek to identify possible predictors of outcome and are useful for studying rare diseases or outcomes. They are often used to generate hypotheses that can then be studied via prospective cohort or other studies.},

In doing this, we briefly review the paradigm “wars” and incompatibility thesis, we show some commonalities between quantitative and qualitative research, we explain the tenets of pragmatism, we explain the fundamental principle of mixed research and how to apply it, we provide specific sets of designs for the two major types of mixed methods research (mixed-model designs and mixed-method designs), and, finally, we explain mixed methods research as following (recursively) an eight-step process. A key feature of mixed methods research is its methodological pluralism or eclecticism, which frequently results in superior research (compared to monomethod research). Mixed methods research will be successful as more investigators study and help advance its concepts and as they regularly practice it.},

MVC programming is the application of a three-way factoring, whereby objects of different classes take over the operations related to the application domain, the display of the application's state, and the user interaction with the model and the view. We present several extended examples of MVC implementations and of the layout of composite application views. The Appendices provide reference materials for the Smalltalk-80 programmer wishing to understand and use MVC better within the Smalltalk-80 system.},

All you need is one book: Business and Competitive Analysis, Second Edition . This generation’s definitive guide to business and competitive analysis has now been thoroughly updated with additional methods, applications and examples. Craig S. Fleisher and Babette E. Bensoussan begin with a practical primer on the process and context of business and competitive analysis: how it works, how to avoid pitfalls, and how to communicate results. Next, they introduce their unique FAROUT method for choosing the right tools for each assignment. The authors then present dozens of today’s most valuable analysis methods. They cover “classic” techniques, such as McKinsey 7S and industry analysis, as well as emerging techniques from multiple disciplines: economics, corporate finance, sociology, anthropology, and the intelligence and futurist communities. You’ll find full chapters outlining effective analysis processes; avoiding pitfalls; communicating results; as well as drill-downs on analyzing industries, competitive positioning, business models, supply chains, strategic relationships, corporate reputation, critical success factors, driving forces, technology change, cash flow, and much more. For every method, Fleisher and Bensoussan present clear descriptions, background context, strategic rationales, strengths, weaknesses, step-by-step instructions, and references. The result is a book every analyst, strategist, and manager can rely on – in any industry, for any challenge.},

  abstract = {WWW (World Wide Web) is a giant dynamic network and a repository of interconnected documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks. Web bots or crawlers are used to recursively traverse and download web pages for search engines to create and maintain their web indices. Search engines largely rely on bots to collect information from the web. Moreover, the need of maintaining the up-to-date pages causes repeated traversal of websites by bots. Due to this, the resources like CPU cycles, disk space and network bandwidth etc., become overloaded which may lead to crashing of website and increase in web traffic. To minimize negative aspects of this traffic on websites, the access as well as behaviors of bots may be regulated at an individual web server by implementing the Robots Exclusion Protocol through “robots.txt”. It is a mechanism for www servers to indicate to bots which part of their server should not be accessed. Thus, this protocol aids in controlling the bot's activity. Bots that follow the Robot Exclusion Protocol are called Ethical Bots. Not all bots are benign however, not all bots follow Robot Exclusion Protocol, some simply ignore “Robots.txt”.  These bots are called spamming bots, they go through your website looking for web forms and email addresses to send you spam. Also these bots probe your website for security vulnerabilities. Spammers use such bots to scan for email addresses for sending spam. Also these spamming bots takes up an enormous amount of bandwidth. This can cause websites to exceed their bandwidth limit and be taken down temporarily. This is especially troublesome for mirror sites which host many gigabytes of data. To prevent, the bandwidth of website from being eaten up and harvesting of other private information like email addresses to send spam, their access need to be blocked. Access of such bots can be blocked with “.htaccess File”.},
